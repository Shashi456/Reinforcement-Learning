# Lecture 1
## Key points 
- The course will basically cover topics ranging from supervised learning
to decision making, Model-free algorithms like Q-Learning, policy gradient
methods and actor-critic methods, Advanced model learning and predictions 
methods, topics from transfer and meta-learning and finally topics on 
exploration and general open problems in RL.
- Intelligent machines must be able to adapt.
- Reinforcement Learning provides a formalism for behaviour, It is basic 
technique of taking decisions in the real world and having consequences in
the form of objectives we care about evaluated through rewards which give
feedback to the decision making system. 
- Deep reinforcement learning, leveraging deep learning allows for end to
end learning where in the NN models the world and helps in the decision and 
this is easily evaluated. 
- Deep RL is better than standard ways because, the pipelines are more 
streamlined and more info can be processed towards your decision making.
- Some interesting papers, Kalashnikov et al '18,
